## The upcoming version 4

Dear Webscraping Community,

**Scrapoxy 4**, the super proxies aggregator, is currently in heavy preparation and will soon be released. This latest version represents a full rewrite, the results of almost two years of dedicated investment, and is **tailored for the webscraping industry**.

I would like to thanks all the contributors who have helped me during these years to make this project a reality. 
Today, I am now fully dedicated to this project, for the next years ahead thanks to [Wiremind](https://www.wiremind.io).

The tech stack is built on the latest [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/), [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), utilizing the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) frameworks.

Here are the included features:

- Support for **Cloud providers** such as [AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/), [Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), [GCP](https://cloud.google.com/), [OVH](https://www.ovhcloud.com/), [Digital Ocean](https://www.digitalocean.com/), and many more on the horizon
- Compatibility with **Proxies providers** like [Zyte](https://www.zyte.com/), [Rayobyte](https://rayobyte.com/), [IPRoyal](https://iproyal.com/), [Proxyrack](https://www.proxyrack.com/), with additional providers being added regularly
- Integration with **Hardware providers** like [Proxidize](https://proxidize.com/)
- Seamless compatibility with free HTTP/HTTPS proxies
- Intelligent traffic routing across proxies, following a robust anti-ban strategy
- Effortless management of **sticky sessions** (including web browser support)
- Autoscaling proxies to optimize costs with both upscale and downscale capabilities
- Real-time request and response **rewriting** on-the-fly
- Modern authentication methods, including Google and Github
- End-to-end **encryption** of traffic between the master and proxies
- **Distributed** architecture on [Docker](https://www.docker.com/), [Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io/), [RabbitMQ](https://www.rabbitmq.com/) and [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- Stability with more than 500 end-to-end tests
- And there's a lot more exciting features in the pipeline!

As always, Scrapoxy **remains open source**, ensuring that the web scraping community can continue to benefit from its capabilities.

Stay tuned Github for the official release announcement, and I can't wait to see how Scrapoxy 4 elevates your webscraping projects to new heights!

Fabien.
