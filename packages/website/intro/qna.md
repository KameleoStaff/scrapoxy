# Questions & Answers

## General

### Can I access to the master without username:password (e.g. http://localhost:8888) ?

Scrapoxy typically uses a `username:password` combination to select the appropriate project 
and as a security measure to prevent unauthorized access to the master.

However, you can bypass this security layer by using the [proxy-chain](https://www.npmjs.com/package/proxy-chain) library.
    
```js
const puppeteer = require('puppeteer');
const proxyChain = require('proxy-chain');

(async() => {
    const proxyUrl = await proxyChain.anonymizeProxy({
        url: 'http://username:password@localhost:8888',
        port: 38888
    });

    // Prints something like "http://127.0.0.1:38888"
    console.log(proxyUrl);

    const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
        args: [`--proxy-server=${proxyUrl}`],
    });

    // Do your magic here...
    const page = await browser.newPage();
    await page.goto('https://www.example.com');
    await page.screenshot({ path: 'example.png' });
    await browser.close();

    // Clean up
    await proxyChain.closeAnonymizedProxy(proxyUrl, true);
})();
```


### Can I host the fingerprint server myself?

Unfortunately, self-hosting the fingerprint server is not possible.

Here are the reasons:

1. **Data**: The server provides GEO IP information using a sophisticated algorithm, not just a basic free database. This algorithm is proprietary and will not be released as open source.
2. **Whitelisting**: Some providers require domain whitelisting. Extensive discussions with their technical and legal teams were necessary to secure this.

To secure this component within the infrastructure,
it would be greatly appreciated if [a sponsorship could be considered](sponsorships.md) 
instead of covering the server's hosting costs. üôè


## Errors

### I've got an error `no such file or directory, open 'scrapoxy.json'` at startup

This is a standard warning that occurs during the initial launchof Scrapoxy
when the configuration file has not been created yet.

Subsequently, you may encounter the following error:

```shell
Cannot read store: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open 'scrapoxy.json' 
```


### At login, I've got the error `JwtInvalidError: JWT is invalid: JWT missing`

This error can occur for the following reasons:

1. Incorrect login/password;
2. When returning to the UI with outdated cookies, requiring a re-login;
3. If Scrapoxy is hosted on HTTP but the `FRONTEND_SECURE_COOKIE` environment variable is set to 1.


### Instances are never up

There can be multiple reasons for this error:

![Instances never up](instances_never_up.png)

#### Cause 1: Adding an existing connector to an installation

When adding a connector from a prior setup, be aware that the certificate, won't be transferred.
This discrepancy arises because Scrapoxy embeds a unique TLS certificate within the instance image to secure communication with the Master.
As a result, the certificate may not match between the existing instance and the newly integrated Scrapoxy connector.
To address this issue, it's recommended to uninstall and then reinstall the connector for proper synchronization.

#### Cause 2: Deploying a single image across multiple zones or regions

It's important to note that most cloud providers restrict the use of a image across various zones or regions.
It is recommended to perform a separate connector installation for each new zone or region you wish to operate in.

#### Cause 3: Firewall forbids Scrapoxy access to instances

Scrapoxy needs the ability to access the open port (default is 3128) on the instance.
This access facilitates the acquisition of the instance's fingerprint and enables the proper relay of traffic.
Ensure that your firewall settings include a rule that permits this access.


## Proxy

### Can I add my own proxies such as Squid with Scrapoxy?

Yes, Scrapoxy allows for the incorporation of personal proxies.
It supports proxy lists with the [free proxies connector](../connectors/freeproxies/guide) to integrate them.


### Why does Scrapoxy not support multiple IP addresses for a single instance?

In theory, it's possible with cloud providers.
We can integrate multiple IPs and network interfaces. However, it boils down to economics.
When you lease an instance, it includes a public IP at no additional cost.
Adding extra IPs incurs additional charges, and for the cheapest instances, the cost of an extra IP can be nearly as much as the instance itself.
Moreover, there's a limit on the number of extra IPs you can add to an instance type, complicating cost-effectiveness.
